A group of classmates meets for a reunion. They talk about their lives so far and how they’ve dealt with problems and crises at home and work. One member, Michael, describes how his company almost floundered before he heard a story that changed his attitude and helped turn the company around. He tells the story to the group:

Long ago and far away, two mice and two very small people live together in a large Maze where they search for cheese. The mice, Sniff and Scurry, find a big stash of their favorite cheese; nearby, the “Littlepeople,” Hem and Haw, also locate plenty of “Cheese,” in their case, the things in life that people desire. They all settle in to enjoy the bounty.

The mice keep their running shoes close by and daily check the station for any changes—cheese going bad or running short—while the humans store away their shoes, put on slippers, and simply enjoy their pile of Cheese.
